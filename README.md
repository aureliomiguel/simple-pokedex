# Simple Pokedex using PokeAPI

This project is a simple Pokedex web application that displays information about Pokemon using the PokeAPI. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To create this project, the following steps were taken:

1. The project was initialized with the necessary files and folders, including index.html, style.css, and script.js.
2. The HTML structure of the application was created, including a search input field, a search button, and a results container to display the information about the searched Pokemon.
3. The CSS file was used to style the HTML elements, including the background, fonts, colors, and layout of the application.
4. The JavaScript file was used to handle the user input and retrieve data from the PokeAPI. This was done by making an HTTP request to the API using the Fetch API and parsing the response to display the relevant information about the searched Pokemon.
5. The application was tested to ensure that it was functioning correctly, and any bugs or errors were fixed.

Overall, this project was a relatively simple application that leverages the power of the PokeAPI to display information about Pokemon. It provides a good introduction to using APIs in web development and demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used together to create a functional and visually appealing web application.
